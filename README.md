hey thanks for dropping by. this project is all about virtual drums which is mainly made by using opencv and python.

STEP 1
*** IMPORT THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES ***
```python
import cv2 #as the application is based on opencv
import numpy as np # we need arrays to define the upper and lower limits of the colours used. 
import pyautogui #used to control the mouse and keyboard
import imutils #to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization easier with OpenCV.
```
