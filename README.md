***VIRTUAL DRUMS***

Hey!! Thanks for dropping by.

This project is virtual drums which is made by using opencv and python.

The basic logic of this project is colour detection and giving the output based on the colour stick used. While the camera is on we get all the pads on the screen and there are colours indicated to each pad. When we take the red stick to the red color outlined tab, that tab will produce its sound.

While running this code please open https://www.onemotion.com/drum-machine/ in the background and run the code to hear the beats.
